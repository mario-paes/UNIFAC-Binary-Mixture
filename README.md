Activity Coefficients for
a binary mixture of 2,2-Dimethylbutane
&amp; Chloroform

from UNIFAC via Thermo Library

species 1 consists of two functional groups
{1:4, 3:2} means subgroup 1 (CH3) with a count of 4
and subgroup 3 (CH) with a count of 2
so this is 2,2-Dimethylbutane

the 2nd compound has only one functional group
{50:1} means subgroup (CHCl3) at count 1
this is Chloroform
